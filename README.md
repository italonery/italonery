# Hi, I'm Italo Nery! 👋

I'm a **Software Engineer** and Back-end Developer, passionate about building robust, scalable, and high-impact solutions that solve real-world problems.  
My carreer is focused on the **.NET** and **Java** ecosystems, but I also have strong experience with **Python** for automation (RPA) and data tasks.
